This mod adds a weapon called "Bone Saw."  It is meant to be an alternative to the muramasa incase you can't find one in the dungeon or if you prefer this weapon instead.  This weapon can't be used in the crafting recipe for the night's edge.  It is slower than the muramasa but does more damage and functions as an axe.  To craft one yourself, you need 10 bones and 3 iron bars at a bone welder.
